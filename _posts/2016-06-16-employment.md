#### Coming up in July:

In March, PSRC kicked off the process to create a new Regional Economic Strategy for the Puget Sound Region. The new strategy will enhance understanding of the forces that drive the region’s economy, inform the region’s land use and transportation planning, and support state and local economic development initiatives. We will continue to examine job sector and other economic trends as the strategy is developed. For more information visit: http://www.psrc.org/econdev/res/.
