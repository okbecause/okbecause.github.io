#### Region starts off 2016 by adding 150 jobs per day

The region added 150 jobs per day, totaling 4,500 jobs in the first month of 2016. The majority of the job gains occurred in King and Snohomish Counties. The annual job growth rate remained around 3% in January 2016 despite a time when the retail sector traditionally ends seasonal holiday work. In December 2015, the region gained 5,200 jobs.

The region has continued to experience robust job growth in the past six years. The region has added 269,600 jobs since January 2010. The region gained 58,000 jobs since January 2015, which is 6% higher than 54,600 jobs added between January 2014 and January 2015. The regional civilian labor force increased 1.6% since January 2015 and the unemployment rate in January 2016 remained at 5.3%.

#### Coming up in April
