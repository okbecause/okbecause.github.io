Datasets just keep getting bigger. The old fileserver-based workflow is giving way to one embracing databases, scripting, data warehouses, and team-based file sharing sites. We love building dashboards that can help understand or debug your data.

* Our specialty is scripting analysis workflows using free, open-source technologies including Leaflet, R/Shiny and several Python-based visualization packages
* We can also help with commercial options including CityPhi and ArcGIS.

If you're looking to open up your data to the world—or if you need some coaxing to learn why it's so important to do so—our experience implementing data APIs can help.
