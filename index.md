The Puget Sound Performance Trends program communicates whether the region’s goals, expressed through adopted plans, are being met.

* Is our region developing in a manner that is consistent with the Regional Growth Strategy?
* Do activities in the region minimize harm to and protect and sustain the natural environment?
* Is the economy strong, and does it provide opportunity for all?
* Do we have efficient and safe transportation choices that support our growth strategy and offer greater options and better mobility?

Each trend's data source is refreshed at least annually, with some trends having more frequent updates.
