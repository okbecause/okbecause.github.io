### Transportation

In close collaboration with PSRC stakeholders, the Transportation 2040 Performance Trends Program has been developed to identify measurable ways to tell the story as to how regional goals are being achieved. Transportation outcome measures have been identified in key areas, including: Environment, Health, Equity, Safety, Security, Mobility, Finance and Maintenance and Preservation.

The Transportation 2040 Performance Trends program evaluates the performance of the regionâ€™s long-range transportation plan, Transportation 2040, as well as addresses performance-based planning measures and targets established under federal law.
