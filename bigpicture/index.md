## The Big Picture: Why track performance trends?

Tracking performance is an important evaluation tool for planning. It functions as a critical feedback loop that provides the basis for assessing how well the region is meeting its stated planning objectives. Monitoring supports informed decision-making by telling us where we’re succeeding and where we’re not, as well as identifying when we may need additional information. It helps us think about how the region might adjust current policies, strategies and programs to produce better results.

#### Guiding Principles and Approach

* PSRC Performance Trends is a coordinated program designed to track the performance of three regional plans: VISION 2040, Transportation 2040, and the Regional Economic Strategy.

* Monitoring measures selected to represent key regional planning objectives. The measures are meaningful and relevant to intended audiences: PSRC Boards, members, partners, regional and local planning staff.

* The approach entails ongoing, repeated tracking of the same measures over time to evaluate progress.

#### Monitoring Framework and Terminology

**Performance Monitoring.** Tracks real world trends relevant to stated regional planning objectives

**Implementation Monitoring.** Tracks whether policies, actions and strategies are being implemented as intended; “are we doing what we said we would do?”

**Policy.** Refers to VISION 2040 multicounty planning policies

**Action.** Refers to VISION 2040 implementation actions

**Strategy.** Refers to the VISION 2040 regional growth strategy, as well as the regional transportation and economic development strategies established in the Transportation 2040 and Regional Economic Strategy functional plans

**Planning Objective.** The desired end-state condition to be effected through regional policies, actions and strategies

**Outcome.** A statement/expression of the desired end-state condition that describes the intended planning objective of a regional policy, action or strategy
Measure
**.** The measurement utilized to track progress in relationship to the desired outcome; measures are value-neutral

**Indicator.** An evaluative interpretation of a measure, i.e. if things are on-track, off-track, or somewhere in between; indicators are not value-neutral, they are interpretative

#### Performance Measure “Architecture”

**Measure.** Definition of the measure, including a brief title and description

**Benchmark.** Describes how progress toward the desired outcome is to be defined, e.g. by the direction of a measure’s movement, by comparison to a threshold value, etc.

**Data.** List of data items needed for measurement and data source

**Reporting Geography.** Geographic scale at which measurement will occur

**Reporting Frequency.** Frequency with which measurement will occur

**Notes.** Additional notes on data sources, caveats, other relevant background information
